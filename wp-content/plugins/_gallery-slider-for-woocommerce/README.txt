== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= When can I use this plugin? =
You can use this plugin only when you have installed the WooCommerce plugin.

= Is the plugin compatible with my theme? =
Yes, the plugin is compatible with the most popular WooCommerce themes. We’re using this ‘woocommerce_before_single_product_summary’ this hook to override the gallery. If your theme is using the default WooCommerce hook for the single-product.php page then this plugin will work perfectly. Sometimes it may require a small CSS tweak.
